; ColorDef_Sloan2colors_from_Sloan.ini
; Defines color workflow in which two Sloan colors SG-SR and SR-SI are
;    determined from images taken in 3 Sloan filters SG, SR, and SI (= Sloan g', r', i').
; Caution: SG, SR, and SI may refer either to physical filters or to standard passbands.

[Targets]
; One target color defined per line.
Target Colors = SG-SR
                SR-SI

[Reference]
; Reference filter and passband must match in Filter sections below.
Filter = SR
Passband = SR

[Filter SG]
Name = Sloan g' (SG)
Target Passband = SG
Transform CI = SG-SR

[Filter SR]
Name = Sloan r' (SR)
Target Passband = SR
Transform CI = SR-SI

[Filter SI]
Name = Sloan i' (SI)
Target Passband = SI
Transform CI = SR-SI
